Voxels brought to bevy.

---

### WARNING!

This crate is in a Proof of Concept stage of development and is not ready to be used in projects!

But keep an eye on it ðŸ™‚

![Block types](/docs/block_types.png)

### To run

Two ducks:

```sh
cargo run --release --features="bevy/bevy_winit","bevy/dynamic" --example rubberduck
```

2N + 1 x 2N + 1 ducks stresstest:

```sh
cargo run --release --features="bevy/bevy_winit","bevy/dynamic" --example rubberduck -- --stress <N>
```

### Why the name

It is a pun on bevy + bewilder, didn't want to give it a generic name like bevy_voxels. The plugin is somewhat opinionated so the name suits it well.

### Next up

As this is still a PoC, features are incrementally added

- [x] Move to bevy 0.8
- [ ] Different types of voxels
- [ ] Combine individual voxels into "pouches" to use instance rendering
